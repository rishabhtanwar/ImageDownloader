Image-Loader
This is a sample android application to implement an ImageLoader that will load remote images into an ImageView asynchronously without any third party library. 

Modern image loading library for Android. Simple by design, powerful under the hood.

- **Kotlin**: Simple Image Loader is Kotlin-native and uses no any dependencies except [Disk LRU Cache]
- **Fast**: contains lots of optimizations: memory cache, disk cache, images downsampling, requests cancelling and more
- **Simple**: minimal boilerplate, simple API, based on every-day needs, extensible for features you need
- **Flexible**: Easy to use, Images loaded in recylerview without any third party library.
